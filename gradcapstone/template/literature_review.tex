\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Introduction}
    Continuous Integration (CI) has grown in popularity, being used in both enterprise and open source projects. CI provides an increase in productivity to programming projects by creating an 
    environment where building, testing, and often deployment is done automatically. When developers do not need to do these tasks manually they can spend more time programming and finding bugs that 
    trigger a failed build or failed test. Most research into CI looks at increasing productivity of developers and the enforcement of development standards. The potential use of CI for security has 
    been mostly overlooked with most research looking at exploiting and protecting a CI system or a CI pipeline and not at the benefits of a pipeline focusing on application security.

	A separate pipeline for security could provide a number of benefits for a security baseline. It could force certain configurations such as Content Security Policy in web applications, or lack of 
    use of depreciated crypto algorithms such as DES or TripleDES \cite{Vehent}. A pipeline that looks only at big win configurations such as these would serve a similar function as Automated Source 
    Code Analysis Tools (ASCAT) do when looking at code meeting project coding guidelines \cite{Zampetti}. The pipeline could also include ASCATs that search for security bugs in a warning stage to 
    avoid wasted time with failed builds from false positive. Another potential feature is an inclusion of fuzzers, which were recently used against memory forensic tools to look into anti-forensics 
    techniques through crashing the tools \cite{Case}.

\subsection{Test case generation}
    Test case generation is a discipline that focuses around automatically generate unit tests for Software Engineering projects. The discipline sometimes focuses on generating tests from a base,
    such as the source code or a config file, and generating a set of tests from the base or it focuses on taking existing tests and expanding them to cover more features.

    One paper from the 2014 Automated Software Engineering conference looked at generating test cases for web from an existing selenium test suite \cite{WebTestGeneration}. 
    This paper goes through the method that is used to generate the new test cases. The method starts by taking a selenium test suite and going though it keeping track of states, 
    http element interactions, and test case assertions. It uses the base states and element interactions to create a State-Flow Graph, which is a graph of the states with the interactions 
    that that move from one state to the next and the assertions that are involved to a single state. It then uses a web crawler on each state to discover alternate paths and new states. 
    It then makes use of assertions on the base states to generate new tests for the crawler discovered states. An example given in the paper is that an application that allows you to 
    create notes is tested with selenium by logging in, clicking the create note element, and then verifying that an id element had specific text. The test suite was then expanded by crawling
    to find the edit note interaction and the delete note interaction. These were then clicked and tested using the assertion, verifying that the id was present and changing the text to match the
    new interactions result text.

\subsection{Test case selection}
    The idea behind test case selection is limiting tests run to save on time during builds. As a code base grows, the number of tests increase. The increase in tests make it more and more expensive
    and eventually becomes to big a load to do everytime \cite{googletest, googlescale}. This has lead to ways of avoiding running all of the tests on every code change. The ways of running tests
    have historically been either rerun all of the tests or manually pick test cases to run based off of the changes the developer made.

    A paper by Milos Gligoric looks at comparing manual test selection against research made into automatic test selection, where automatic test selection would only run the tests that test code
    affected by the changes a developer made \cite{TestCaseSelction}. The state of the automatic test selection tools were limited to Google and Microsoft at the time of the paper. The tools were
    impractical for use by smaller projects because they were either too imprecise, selected tests that were not affected by the code changes, or unsafe, failed to guarentee all tests not selected
    were unaffected by the code changes. The paper specifically compares 14 developers manual test choices against a tools automated test selection. The paper found that manual test case selection
    was most commonly done during debugging. It also found the 73\% of the time manual RTS selected more tests than were necessary and 74\% of the time some tests that were affected were missed.

\subsection{Effective use of CI}
	Continuous integration has been a fantastic addition to Software Engineering practices by removing repetitive administrative tasks. The less steps a software engineer has to go through when 
    producing new code, the more time they can spend on adding features, squashing bugs, or otherwise improving the project code base. There is plenty of research done into the use of CI 
    including many case studies, papers and presentations looking at how to setup CI and Continuous Deployment (CD), and papers looking at specific configurations of CI.
	
	CI can be integrated with all sorts of tools to increase productivity. The paper How Open Source Projects use Static Code Analysis Tools in Continuous Integration Pipelines by Fiorella Zampett 
    looks at how Static Code Analysis tools in a CI pipeline effects projects \cite{Zampetti}. The paper found that the most utilized feature of ASCATs was to ensure a project's code was consistent 
    by ensuring the developers coding guidelines were met. The paper also found that ASCATs caused broken builds to be fixed quickly in an average of 8 hours and one build. There are a number of 
    recommendations that this paper provides which outline how to set up ASCATs in a CI pipeline, what to think about when doing so, and what to expect to maintain the ASCAT. Adding a source code 
    analysis tool will help keep a project consistent while helping point out bugs that could be missed by developer made unit tests.

	Two papers look at CI and how it affects projects in general. Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance: A Case Study of Two Open Source Projects by Jesper Holck and Usage, Costs, and Benefits
    of Continuous Integration in Open-Source Projects by Michael Hilton both look at open source projects and how CI affects them \cite{Hilton,Holck}. The papers found that CI often replaces the 
    practice of having developers make formal design documents. The developers instead just pick from a list of tasks and works on completing them and merging them into the code base. The papers also
    found that most developers like CI and plan to use it again in future projects. For projects that did not use CI it was found that the reason was usually just that the developers were not 
    familiar with how to set up and use CI. Both papers found CI to be successful in increasing productivity, causing projects to release twice as often, accept pull requests quicker, and have 
    developers less worried about breaking the project. 

\subsection{Security in CI pipelines}
	Security conferences often look into how to break systems as a way of pointing out the flaws of a configuration. CI servers have also had their share of security professionals testing for exploits
    and looking at the consequences of compromise. CI has also had a little bit of research into how to secure a CI pipeline.

	A presentation at DEFCON named Exploiting Continuous Integration (CI) and Automated Build Systems talked about the consequences of a CI enabled projects \cite{spaceb0x}. The presentation found that 
    exploiting a repo that holds a CI integration ends with a huge amount of access. If the repo links into an internal CI server, then the attacker ends up with internal network access. If the repo 
    links to a CI server with multiple CI instances or also runs the CD, then the attacker will get more source code and access to the deployment machines because the CI holds a way to connect to the 
    deployment servers. Otherwise the attacker ends up with environment variables which often hold extremely sensitive information.

	A paper by Len Bass called Securing a Deployment Pipeline looks at how to secure a CI pipeline to limit the damage in case of exploitation \cite{Bass}. The paper details a way to break a pipeline 
    down into trusted and untrustworthy parts, segmenting operations until an untrustworthy segment cannot be broken down any more. The CI pipeline then holds parts that are guaranteed to be 
    trustworthy and run as expected, minus specific cases outlined in the paper, and parts that may provide untrustworthy output. By limiting the scope of untrustworthy parts, the rest of the pipeline
    can run as expected and it is possible to see where the most risk lies. Then the owners of the pipeline can work to limit access to the untrustworthy portions and look into solutions to make those
    portions trustworthy.

\subsection{Use of CI for Security}
    There is little research into the use of CI for security. One presentation by Mozilla looks at the use of CI to tackle easy fixes in response to their bug bounty program \cite{Vehent}. The 
    presentation looks at using CI to ensure that the production environment contains configurations that mirror best practices for common web application security bugs. Some examples include HSTS
    is enabled, CSP for XSS bugs, various X-OPTIONS headers, Cookies have secure, Cross origin sharing, and Subresource integrity checks. The presentation recommends figuring out a security baseline
    for a projects CI pipeline, drive testing from the CI pipeline, and empower the team to fix the issues. Another recommendation is not to break on deployment into production as that could break the
    production site if configured poorly. The end result of mozilla's CI setup was a large drop in bug reports that the CI tests aimed to fix.

\subsection{Work and methodology}
	The work into CI so far has shown that CI is useful tool for developers to ease the creation of new features. CI has spread to open source projects and is deployed in most organizations that have 
    at least one large code project. The security side of how a CI is dangerous if exploited and how to secure a pipeline against attacks has had little research. The most interesting thing that I 
    think is lacking is the look into how CI can be used to improve the security the project that it is integrated on.
	
	Most of the research does not mention how CI could help improve the security of a project. Some ways this could be done are through targeting common bugs that are already fixed. Some examples
    are ensuring that CSP is enabled, HSTS is enabled, parameterized queries are used, binary protections are enabled in compilation scripts, and unsafe functions are not used. Some of these are
    implemented already in some source code analysis tools, but these tools often have high levels of false positives. Another use could be in including fuzzing in a pipeline. I have not seen any
    research into automating fuzzing into testing an application. Depending on the project it could be a very useful tool to find bugs.

    The research I am doing involves creating a pipeline with tests that focus on specific frameworks and are tailored towards an application instead of general language based tests. Most source
    code analysis tools look at specific languages instead of focusing on specific libraries or frameworks \cite{bandit, findbugs, findsecbugs}. My tests will also do some dynamic testing
    instead of just focusing on source code analysis to verify that the protections are in place in a live application. I am following a similar path to Mozilla in using tests to mandate security
    configurations \cite{Vehent}.
