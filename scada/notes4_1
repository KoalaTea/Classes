Sensor network security goals and services
    data integrity
    data freshness

tinysec
    a light-weight generic security framework for sensor networks
    entirely software based
    encrypt and authenticate all communications w/o much performance degradation

Security Goals & focus
    WSN suffer from all issues typically associated with wireless
        easy to eavesdrop, inject, alter data
    WSN are also susceptible to
        Resource consumption...

Security Primitives: MAC Message Authentication Code
Security Primitives: IV
    semantic security
    Adversaries should have no better than 50% change of guessing any yes/no question about message

TinyOS
    30bytes frame (8bytes IV is alot of overhead)

Design goals
    Security
        Authentication and Message intgrity
        Confident
        not replay protection
    Performance
        Cryptography increase message size
        tune sec strength for reasonable protection to minimal cost
    ease of use
        sec platform for higher level protocols
        transparenc
        portability

Security Replay protection
    let applications put it in not at link layer

TinySec design goals performance
    overhead with cryptographic solutions
        incease in message length
            decrease throughput
            increase latency
            intrease power consumption
        increas in cpu ram usage

design goals ease of use
    higher level sec rprotocol will rely on tinysec

2 options
    tinysec-auth
        authentication only
        only ensure data recieved is from a trusted mode
        good when data does not need to be private
    tinysec-AE
        auth and encryption
        MAC computered over encrypted data and the packet header
        ensures data recieved is from a trusted node
        prevents adversaries from seeing data
