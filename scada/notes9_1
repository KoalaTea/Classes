Thursday next week is exam
    tinysec minisec routing (XMesg) Zigbee

Zigbee
    zigbee is not == 802.15.4
    Network Characteristics
        operate reliably for years without intervention
        long battery life
        low infra costs
        low complexity small size
        low data rate
        QoS requirements low
        form by themselves
        scale to large sizes up to 65k nodes
    Alliance
        ...
    802.15.4
        MAC
        Phy (wireless ranges GHz MHz)

        security
        network
            star mesh cluster-tree
    ZIGBEE Node
                 micro controller  TX + RX antenna
        sensing, computation,      communication
        can support multiple sensing sub-units depending on the application (sensing)

        can operate as full function device (FFD) or reduced function device (RFD)
        RFD no relaying
        Sink -> definitely FFD
        sensor nodes maybe FFD or RFD

    ZIGBEE Device Types
        coordinator -FFD, network management
            each network has one coordinator
        Router - FFD used in tree and mesh topologies to expand network coverage
            does everything coordinator does except starting a network
        End Device - can be RFD - consumes less power
            has to be connected to router or coordinator
    do not want singlepoint of failure
        star, tree design
        mesh avoids this, gives multiple paths to coordinator
            makes us have to deal with routing

    Security in ZIGBEE
        Goals conf, integ, authent, replay protection
        replay protection relies on frame counters
        AES CCM uses CRT for encryption and CBC for MAC
        32 to 128 bit MAC
        8 byte IV sent with packet
        can have 30 byte overhead!
    ZIGBEE Trust Center (TC)
        dedicated network device or coordinator that is trusted by other parties in the network
        storeds a list of devices and link keys, network keys
            A set of network keys is held by the Trust Center and current network key is identified
                by a key sequence number
