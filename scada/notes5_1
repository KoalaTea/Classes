    constrained

    not
        weak crypto
        intended to replace traditional crypto
            focus limited by operational constraints
example area: sensors/IOT
    traditional asymmetric cryptosystems do not perform very well
        N = pq
        phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
        gcd(e,phi(n)) = 1
        choose d such that e.d = 1 mod phi(n)
        public key -> e,n
        private -> d
        C = M^e mod n
        M = C^d mon n

Performance AES SHA1
    AES 1.62/2.49 microJ/byte enc/dec
    SHA-1 5.9 microJ/byte

Performance of Block Cipher Modes
    decryption is more power usage
