Sensor network Multi-hop Architectures

medium access
    scheduled access
        someone tells you when to transmit and recieve based on time...
        LEACH
    contention based
        nodes compete for access
        S-MAC

How is energy wasted
    idle listening
        sleep cycle
    collistion avoidance
    message passing
        RTS CTS
    overhearing
        rts cts sleep when neighbors transmitting
    in network processing...

Architecture
    flat-architecture
        sink at end, report up then they report up end at sink
    Hierarchical
        clusting, sinks in each cluster slide 4 Cluster heads communicate and lead to sink

routing
    route holes
        dying connections in flat networks makes impossible to go towards sink

Flat network
    all sensor nodes are peers
    same role - sense and relay
    usually same resources
    contention based MAC
Hierarchical
    ...
    options
        singlhop single tier
            single up in each cluster
        multihop
            multiple hops in a single cluster
        singlehop multitear
            cluter has single hop but clusters in clusters
slide 7 nope
hierarchical wit hschedules
flat with contention

LEACH
    Low energry adaptive clusting hierarchy
    integrates clustering and routing
    integrates sleep cycles
    TDMA CDMA-based MAC protocol for hierarchical networks
    schedule based

    Assumption 
        All nodes can use power control
        rotating cluster-heads
        all nodes can support different MAC protocols

    look at  laters

    Clustering algorithm features
        Requeires cluster heads - localized coordination and control for cluster set-up and operation
        Adaptive clusters and rotating cluster-heads
            randomized rotation of cluster heads
        communication using TDMA within clusters
        managing multiple clusters using CDMA
        cluster-heads communicate with sink directly
        cluser-heads perform data aggregation

    Dynamic clusters
        number of clusters does not change

    0 an 100 no clusters from curve slide 14 5 is optimal which is why 5 clusters
    less than 5 farther from sink more transmition power
    right goes up more cluster heads have to be up more goes to sink

    Cluster Head eletcion Algorithm
        mathhhhhh :(
        Distributed stochastic algorithm
        selection based on 'rounds' of operation
        p - percentage of nodes desired to be cluster-heads
        # of rounds - 1/p
