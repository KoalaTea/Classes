Medium Access Control
    Wireless Medium Access
        Controlling when to send a packet andwhen to recieve a packet
            Challenging with one radio
        Wireless channel is a shared medium
            Wireless channel is a shared medium
            radios transmittin in the same frequency band interfere with each other - collisions
            ethernet is also shared medium
        why the hype for sensor networks

Energy Efficiency in WSN MAC design
    what causes energy wastage?
        collisions
        Idle listening
        Overhearing
        protocol overhead
        computational complexity

MAC design options
    Wireless medium access
    Centralized
        schedule based
            cell networks
        contention based
            wifi
    distributed
        schedule based
            clustering?
        contention based
            free for all no management

    Contention based
        no centralized resource allocaation required    - Advantage
        collisions occur                                - Disadvantage
    Schedule based
        no collisions                                   - Advantage
        requires resource allocation/management control - Disadvantage

    Contention based access
        CSMA/CD 802.3 ethernet MAC
        CSMA/CD Wireless can we implement it?
            CSMA/CD layer 2 acks
                /CA RTS/CTS
                    Request to sent / Clear to send
                    RTS
                    CTS
                    Data
                    Ack
    Hidden Terminal Problem
       /|A \ B / C|\
       A can see B but not C C can see B but not A
       A and C send to B collision occurs but they do not know eachother
       B sends CTS when A and C send RTS

    Virtual Carrier Sensing
        Network Allocation Vector (NAV)

    802.11 CSMA/CA
        how are collisions avoided
            Duration fields -> NAV

    Contention-based MAC? why not single hop?
        sensors

    Sensor MAC Design primary and secondary considerations
        Primary
            Energy Efficiency
            Scalability and Availability
    S-MAC Contention Based Mac Protocol
        Developed by Ye, Heidemann and Estrin
        Goal: Energy Efficiency by reducing idle listening and overhearins, Collision avoidance, In-network processing
        Tradeoff: Latency, per-node Fairness
        some features:
            Periodic listen and sleep - reduce idle listening
            overhearing avoidance
            Collision avoidance capability - RTS/CTS with a difference
            Message Passing (Message level handling)
    Idle listening
        listen__sleep__listen__sleep__...>

    Overhearing Avoidance
        sleep when neighbors talk
    
    Message Passing
        ....

    RTS sets NAV for reciever
    CTS sets NAC for non sender and non reciever sensors

    Energy saving due to avoiding overhearing by using message passing
    Energy saving due to periodic sleep
