    goals
        replay protection, confidentiality, authentication, <integrity?>
        low energy consumption
    modes
        minisec-U
            uses synchronized counters for replay protection
            between pairs of nodes (unicast)
        minisec-B
            uses Bloom filters to keep track of already seen packets for replay protection
            used for broadcasts
    Assumptions
        pre-distributed symmetric keys between communicating parties
            no key management
        routing protocol is in place
            no routing
        minisec-B
            loose time synchronization
    Attacker model
        dolev-yao attacker model
            the advesary can obtain any message
            act as a legitimate user
            can become the reciever to any sender
            can send messages to messages to an entity by impersonating any other entity
    traditional approach authenticated encryption
        encrypt then mac
        cost
            - two encryptions
            - ...
    what is OCB
        authenticate encryption
            encryption and mac in one shot
        computational cost almost same as CBC enc (only once unlike CBC which needs to be run twice to get MAC as well)
        uses single block-cipher key each block-cipher keyed with it
