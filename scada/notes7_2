    man in the middle from serial numbers if asking
    serial numbers used to generate public key
        public private in sensors
    identity based crypto

routing
    paths
        find path dest wher best way
            metrics
    reactive routing vs proactive routing
        proactive
            determines path before
        reactive - infrastructureless
            determines path as needed
    Flat vs heirarchical routing protocols
        hierarchical
            leech leach
        flat
            do not use addresses, data centric
            (directed?).... disfusion
    Network dynamics
        main compononents in sensor network
            senser nodes
            sinks
            monitored events
    Node deployment - how to place nodes
        application dependent
        deterministic - manually places routing through pre-determined paths
        random - self organizing scattered - ad hoc network
            optimal clustering becomes necessary to allow connectivity
    energy considerations
        multi hop more efficient
            more annoying than direct to sink routing wise
        setting up routes - energy aware
            short routes low power tranmission
        direct trans to sink
            not energy efficient
    data delivery models
        time driven - sensors to sink
        event driven - sensors to sink
        query driven - bidirectional
        hybrid
    node capabilities
        homogenous
            same computa same communica same power capacity
        heterogeneous
            ...
    data aggregations, convergecast, in network processing
        reduce data redundancy
        reduce trasmitted data
        suppression
        max min avg
        transmission consumes more energy than computation

    routing protocol for self organizing multihop networks
    do
        discover
        managment
            keep good routes
        selection
            pick best routes
        redistribute as necessary
    single path routing protocol
        how to we determin what is a good route
    any to base routing algorithm
        maximize expected success rate
        minimize total cost
            praent cost - cost to direct parent
            node cost - total cost to sink
            link cost - cost of link to parent
