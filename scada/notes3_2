LEACH cont.

p = percent of nodes as head
1/p = # of rounds
T = p/(1-p(r mod (1/p)))
r = current round
G = # of nodes eligble to be cluster head in this ground

example
r = 0
T = p = 5/100
|G| = 100
...
20 intervals
0|+++++|+++++|+++++|....|++++++|1
       t=5/100                  100/100
  _____ Cluster heads for round 0
r = 1 round 1
T = .005/1-.05(1)
  = .05/.95 = 5/95
|G| = 95
19 intervals
0|+++++|+++++|....|+++++|1
       5/95

r-19
T= .05/1-.95 = 1
|G|= 5
0|+++++|1

Probability based mechanism
after 1/p rounds are over all nodes become eligible to be CH again
    designed so each node becomes a cluster head at least once

phase flow chart
            Am I CH?
    yes                     no
    Announce CH status      -Wait for CH announcement
    Wait for Join_REQ msg   -Send join_Red
    Create TDMA sched send  -Wait for sched from CH
            Enter steady start operations

Cluster communications after CH selection each round
    CH forms clusters
    CH announces a TDMA sched
    ...

sleep periods
    cluster clients can sleep between TDMA slots
    CH must be awake
    each cluster can use CDMA have unique spreading code - intracluster interference

Simulation results for LEACH

pros
    load balancing
    TDMA
    2 hops to read sink
    distributed hierarchical approach
    easy to aggregate data at CH
cons
    CH selection algo
        random selection of CH can lead to non-optimal selections
    Expensive assumption - all nodes capable of long distance transmission
    not query driven or event driven
    failure of CH - network segmentation
    Many others

despite drawbacks idea good and merit has
led to LEACH-C -M -B -F -V....

Security Challenges
    Lack of physical security
    limited physical rsources
    end to end in network prossessing

    limited memory and storage space
        sec colutions cannot have large code space
    Power limitations
        any crypto added should be energy aware
                

semantic security
    repeated encryption of the same plaintext should not come out the same
