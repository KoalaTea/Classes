Minisec
    tinysec goals + replay protection
    both use SKIPJACK - minisec can use others?
    1 pass vs 2 passes in tinysec
    IV management
        tinysec zigbee
            send IV with packet
        SPINS
            synchronized IV at sender and receiver
            disadvantage: resync protocol in case IVs unsync
            IV kept as incrementing counter on both parties
            advantage: eliminate IV in each packet sent
        MiniSec-U
            only send last 3 bits of IV
        SPINS and Zigbee: Per Sender State
    Minisec-B
        How can we detect replay attacks without per-sender state for more than one sender?
        Replay protection approach:
            Case 1: Replaysoutside a timing window
                timing based - detect replays outside of timing window
                    Requires loose time synchronization
            Case 2: ...
        timing based approach
            time intervals
        bloom filters within an epoch
            space efficient data structure for fast probabilistic membership test
                tells rapidly whether an element is present in a set
            probabilistic membership query ....
            if no new places in bloom filter it is a replay
                if at least one then it is not
                one problem is too many messages and bloom filter does not have enough room - false negatives
        Implementation
            ....
        packet overhead
            3 bytes - minisec
            5 bytes - tinysec-AE
