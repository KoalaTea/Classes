Zigbee
    32-128 bit MAC
    8 byte IV
    up to 30 byte packet overhead
    CIA and replay protection

    Centralized Trust Center
        dedicated network device that is trusted by other parties in the network
            usually coordinator is also the TC
        stores a lsit of devices and link keys, network keys
            a set of network keys is held by the Trust Center and current network key is identified by a key sequence number
        types of keys
            network key         - same for entire network
            app layer link key  - pairwise (between two devices) link key with TC preconfigured
            master              - used for network and link key derivations not used for encryption
        performs key update
            perioudically updates network key
            updates the network key by encryptin the new network key with the old network key and sending it our as a boroadcast then request all use new key
        performs device authentication/handles join requests

    security modes
        standard mode
            standard network key
            mem req no incread with network size
            if net key not pre conf sent to node by TC
            no auth
        High Security mode
            TC maintains list of device and keys
            provides auth
    threat models
        network key protects against un authorized nodes
        link keys protects against node that bypassed network key

    end nodes must have a link key with TC to start in High security mode (for auth)

    (link keys were predictable)

    network layer (up to network layer not encrypted, Mac layer would be everything up to MAC layer)
        ciphertext the app layer data
        add auxilary header (IV), add MIC (MAC just different name)
    
    protecting at the APS layer (app layer)
        APS data is encrypted with APS header left alone then all of APS layer is encrypted

    Zigbee 3.0
        allow decentralized security network without the trust center
        every zigbee router authenticates and distributes keys to devices that attempt to join the network
        there is no central node that has a view of all authenticated nodes
            less insight

        Install codes
            link keys used to authenticate a node into a centralized security network are created using install codes
            random install code up to 18 bytes
            MMO Matyas-Meyer-Oseas hash function used to derive the link key from the install code
            TC should have knowledge about the install code on each node!

        what was added to 3.0? - exams
            dist TC response
            install codes instead of preconfigured link keys

        comparision on packet overhead
            Minisec says they good
            tiny sec no replay zigbee 30b overhead

limitations of crypto
    cannot prevent replayed packets
    delayed packets
    traffic analysis
    packet jamming
    malicious insiders, captured nodes
